                  holistically balance his life. He chose piano, and we found Julie through a recommendation from a
                  friend at school. I wasn’t 100% sure my son would stick with it and practice outside of his lessons.
                  But a few months in and he’s loving it! He will be doing his first public(no-pressure) Music share in
                  a couple of weeks. Our son has always responded well to positive feedback and Julie is the most
                  positive and enthusiastic teachers of any I’ve ever met. I’m very proud of my son’s piano

                  our daughter has not only improved on the piano tremendously but also started to sing. Her confidence

                  another because they could not match Julie's ability, knowledge, enthusiasm, or teaching skill. Julie
                  also
                  teaches my son who has Autism spectrum disorder. She took a child who had, for the first 13 years of
                  his life, expressed no interest in music at all and turned him into a composer! She taught him the
                  mechanics of playing and how to express himself through music. This was really

            <p class="pt-2 lead">I believe that music is in all of us! I find such joy in being a part of
              each of student’s
              musical journey! I’ve been honored to take part in countless musical journeys as a music instructor since
              1994. In the lives of my students both young and old, Past and present; I’ve seen the gift of music spark
              creative ideas, challenge students to new performing and competitive opportunities they never knew they
              could achieve, build self-esteem, create amazing composers, and bring healing, therapy, and comfort to my
              students who have special needs, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, depression, or ADHD. <br>
              I’ve witnessed the amazing effects of music over the years in how it helps the very young learn to track
              with eye-movement and small motor skills, accelerate their ability to read, and equip them with social
              skills necessary for school readiness. <br>
              It has helped my students who struggle with dyslexia improve test scores in reading and math!
              The discipline of studying a musical instrument also helps older students learn how to manage their time,
              stick with something until they see the final product, develop a tenacity to work through things when they
              are difficult or not an instant-gratification, and improves memory. Science has proven that musical study
              creates new neuropathways and stimulates areas of the brain in the same way as one who studies a second
              language. Time and time again, evidence shows that students who stick with a musical instrument through high
              school are often the ones at the top of their class! <br>
              My young students, as young as two and three years old learn to present music and speak in front of groups
              of people as performers. This helps them with confidence and prepares them for giving a presentation in
              class, performing in a dance recital, and perhaps doing a presentation in a board meeting one day!
              My Students who are athletes find that their hand-eye coordination greatly improves after several years of
              studying a musical instrument! The benefits of music are endless! <br>
              Every individual deserves a chance to enjoy the many benefits that music has to offer! Berry Music offers
              Individual lessons in Piano, Voice, Guitar, and ukulele for ages 3-adult. Berry music also offers the
              following classes: Baby and Me group classes, Special Needs Music enrichment groups, Preschool Music pals,
              and group theory classes that prep students for the National Federation of Music clubs Annual Theory exam
              each spring. <br>
              I equip each student with a well-rounded music education that involves ear-training, sight-playing, hands-on
              music theory, Rhythm, accompaniment styles, composition, playing and singing. This allows them more success
              when they join their school orchestra, choir, band, audition for a musical, or start up a neighborhood
              garage band! <br>
              Students of Berry music have monthly opportunities to share their gifts with our Senior community at our
              music share events which are held at local assisted living and memory-care communities. This is a casual and
              friendly environment for my 3’s and 4’s to teens feel very comfortable in a performance environment. <br>
              Students feel relaxed in this setting to share music and enjoy the smiles of grateful hearts! In the spring
              there are several local, state, and national competition and exam opportunities as well. <br>
              I am a proud member of several professional organizations including: The National Guild of Piano Teachers,
              The National Federation of Music Clubs, St. Louis Area Music Educators (SLAMTA), and the National Music
              Teachers Association. <br>
              In addition to teaching, I am a composer, song-writer, and performer who enjoys jamming with my Husband (who
              is a musical genius!). I love reading, Running Half-Marathons, Biking, swimming, and training for
              triathlons! My Husband and I have 3 adult children and 3 Teens! We are the musical Berry- bunch! All 6 of
              our kids are musicians as well!
