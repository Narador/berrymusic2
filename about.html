                  holistically balance his life. He chose piano, and we found Julie through a recommendation from a
                  friend at school. I wasn’t 100% sure my son would stick with it and practice outside of his lessons.
                  But a few months in and he’s loving it! He will be doing his first public(no-pressure) Music share in
                  a couple of weeks. Our son has always responded well to positive feedback and Julie is the most
                  positive and enthusiastic teachers of any I’ve ever met. I’m very proud of my son’s piano

                  our daughter has not only improved on the piano tremendously but also started to sing. Her confidence

                  another because they could not match Julie's ability, knowledge, enthusiasm, or teaching skill. Julie
                  also
                  teaches my son who has Autism spectrum disorder. She took a child who had, for the first 13 years of
                  his life, expressed no interest in music at all and turned him into a composer! She taught him the
                  mechanics of playing and how to express himself through music. This was really
